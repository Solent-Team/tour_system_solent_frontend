                      While Sinhala and Tamil are the official and most frequently spoken languages in the nation,

                      All hotels, large restaurants, and businesses speak English.
                      The majority of road signs are written in both Sinhalese and English.

                      Credit cards are widely accepted and widely utilized by local businesses (even in tiny communities).
                      Visa and MasterCard are the most commonly used card kinds, with American Express being utilized to a lesser extent.
                      Using your Credit Card (legal for worldwide usage) whenever feasible would be a convenient choice.

                      Flash photography is not permitted at the Sigiriya frescoes, but where there is no prohibition, please act carefully.
                      Never stand near or in front of a Buddha statue (with your back to it).
                      Such behavior is seen as exceedingly disrespectful. Do not photograph a monk without first obtaining permission.

                      Always use your right hand to offer, receive, and eat. It is exceedingly impolite to eat with your left hand.
                      Respect cultural differences, local laws, and import rules,
                      as well as ensuring that your actions do not breach environmental responsibility.
